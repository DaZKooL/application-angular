## Welcome

Glad to see your first interview went well! This is the starter app for our programming test. Below is some information, you'll get the rest of the info and your specific assignment at the time of your appointment, but it is good to clone the code and get a head start.

## Getting Started

The following steps are required to get started:

1. Clone the project: (`git clone git@github.com:conclusion-digital-cx/application-angular.git`)

2. Install dependencies: (`yarn install`)

3) Run the project: (`ng serve`)

## Some Info

This is a very basic app, we've included bootstrap for the CSS styles, but we haven't included jquery or any of the other dependencies Bootstrap requires. Please know that you will get a warning when installing the application, but that's fine. We're only importing the main bootstrap CSS :)

## Contributing

To close the loop, we would like you to create your own branch to work in and push to. The master branch will be locked and may not be pushed to. In case you have any feedback during or after your application periode, please do not hesitate to give it to us by either mailing to any of the authors below, or giving it straight up in one of your interview chats :)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
